## FAQ

### Can you include Solito?

No. Solito will not be included in this repo. It is a great tool if you want to share code between your Next.js and Expo app. However, the main purpose of this repo is not the integration between Next.js and Expo - it's the codesplitting of your T3 App into a monorepo, the Expo app is just a bonus example of how you can utilize the monorepo with multiple apps but can just as well be any app such as Vite, Electron, etc.

Integrating Solito into this repo isn't hard, and there are a few [offical templates](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos) by the creators of Solito that you can use as a reference.

### What auth solution should I use instead of Next-Auth.js for Expo?

I've left this kind of open for you to decide. Some options are [Clerk](https://clerk.dev), [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs). Note that if you're dropping the Expo app for something more "browser-like", you can still use Next-Auth.js for those.

The Clerk.dev team even made an [official template repository](https://github.com/clerkinc/t3-turbo-and-clerk) integrating Clerk.dev with this repo.

## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# In packages/db/prisma update schema.prisma provider to use sqlite
# or use your own database provider
- provider = "postgresql"
+ provider = "sqlite"

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Prerequisites

_We do not recommend deploying a SQLite database on serverless environments since the data wouldn't be persisted. I provisioned a quick Postgresql database on [Railway](https://railway.app), but you can of course use any other database provider. Make sure the prisma schema is updated to use the correct database._

**Please note that the Next.js application with tRPC must be deployed in order for the Expo app to communicate with the server in a production environment.**

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you have ever deployed a Turborepo app there, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/nextjs` folder as the root directory and apply the following build settings:

> The install command filters out the expo package and saves a few second (and cache size) of dependency installation. The build command makes us build the application using Turbo.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.
